These are my dotfiles. Most are just simple dotfiles in my home
directory. The zsh config has been split into multiple files to
make it less unwieldly.

git clone git@github.com:filterfish/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
ls -d ~/.dotfiles/.* | grep -vw .git | xargs -n1 ln -s

There are two .screenrc files: screenrc.x & .screenrc.no-x one's
for X and one isn't, in case you hadn't worked it out! Remove one
and rename the other if you use the fairly heavy handed sym-linking
method above.
